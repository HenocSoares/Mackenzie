### Lesson Overview:

In Lesson 1, participants were introduced to various activities within Usability Engineering, with a particular focus on the importance of creating prototypes. In Lesson 3, the significance of prototypes as concrete yet partial representations of intended systems was emphasized. Prototypes can be developed using basic materials such as paper or sophisticated computational tools.

### Task Description:

For this project, participants are required to complete two tasks:

1. Develop a low-fidelity prototype of the user interface project, utilizing either paper or digital tools, as outlined in the lesson material.

### Additional Notes:

- Participants can refer to the resources provided in the "Exploring Concepts" section of Lesson 3 for guidance on prototype creation tools. However, they are free to explore other options if desired.
- It is essential to adhere to interface design principles throughout the prototyping process.

### Presentation Details:

For the initial presentation, only the results of Task 1 (low-fidelity prototype) will be presented. Depending on the quality and necessity, further tasks may be added subsequently.
