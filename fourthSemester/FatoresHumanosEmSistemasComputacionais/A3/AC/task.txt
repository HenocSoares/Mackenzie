In Lesson 1, you learned about various activities in Usability Engineering, one of which is "Create prototypes." In Lesson 3, it was emphasized that a prototype is a concrete but partial representation of the intended system, which can be created using simple materials like paper or with the use of computational tools.

What needs to be done:

You and your group must develop a low-fidelity prototype of the user interface project, either on paper or using a tool, as described earlier.
You and your group must develop a high-fidelity prototype of the user interface project, as described earlier.
Notes:

In the "Exploring Concepts" section of Lesson 3, there are videos about prototype creation tools, but you and your group may use others if desired.

Remember to consider interface design principles when creating the prototypes.

With the group you formed in Lesson 1, post the activity's results here.
